# LungCare Mobile Application

## Introduction

LungCare is an application that can reduce misdiagnosis using machine learning models as well as
giving patients an early diagnosis. LungCare is made to give patients a quick diagnosis to their
lung x-ray. This would help patients who have to wait days for their doctors appointment by speeding
up the diagnosis process. The application will also give patients tips and help on handling their
situation so that they can act on it rather than wait for a doctors appointment.
